problem:  when passed a FindByRecordingID = 4 to CatalogAdapter it returns all as expected except duration, which is 0.

[done]check database
  
DAL works - catalogFixture tests tracks
  in CatalogFixture, have added in 2 tracks of different lengths and they work... there is no aggregator, just Track.Duration 


Service - CatalogServiceStubFixture works.. so RecordingAssembler working
	totalRunTime is populating well
	however each track isn't coming back.
	problem was in RecordingAssembler

CatalogServiceInterface looks like it is working.

the top layer test still gives 0 for duration

testing DatabaseCatalogServiceFixture
  trying to make sure that the tracks are being inserted properly.
  not working... cant get it to insert the correct recordingID into db


[done]make a class diagram.
problem is the test isn't strong enough..
   want a full recording with all tables to be populated and tested
	this is done somewhere!

look at source check file.

in DatabaseCatalogServiceFixture... the dto.totalRunTime.. is 0
